# [Counting] Stars

## Idea

Humans are quite bad at estimating the number of things they see, so in this little game you'll need to estimate the number of things you see.

## Modes

There're multiple game modes selected at random: 

- Lines of text
  - with numbers
  - with percentages
  - different colors 
- Symbols
  - mixed with other symbols
  - counting number of symbols of given color
  - ordered or not


## Game loop

1. Show text / symbols for X seconds
2. Player writes the number
3. Show image and correct answer
4. Repeat
